# Python Notebooks
Hello, my name is Julio Lau. <br />

This repository is trying to be a place where I put some content based on some books I have (I will eventually add it to the reference list when there's code related to it) with the purpose to show what I like, know and learn. <br />

Hope you like it &nbsp; '-'/

# Doing now
